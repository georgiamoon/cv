## WXY / Boston Public Schools

We built an interactive map that allows parents/interested people to see what schools are available to them in Boston, given a variety of potential proposals that Boston Public Schools is considering for re-zoning the school districts.

The key challenges here were to develop the tool in a way that is easy to maintain, required very few dedicated web resources, and matched the existing design of the BPS web presence. We used Google Fusion Tables for executing spatial queries, and the Google Maps API & Google Fusion Tables API for displaying the data.

## mapping

Course Objectives

DESCRIPTION. The seminar will explore, yes explore, the theory and practice of mapping. Rather than looking at maps, we will investigate mapping, "the conceptual glue linking the tangible world of buildings, cities, and landscapes with the intangible one of social networks and electronic communications" (Abrams and Hall). We will pay special attention to the visual presentation of spatial data, situating it in a longer history and in the theoretical complications of, and debates about, representation and design. Long before GIS and GPS, there were John Snow's London cholera maps and the visualizations that made possible the imperial colonization of the globe. In the age of high-resolution overhead imagery and Google mash-ups, what other possibilities for practice have emerged? The seminar will oscillate between the theory and practice of mapping, with topics including, what it means to present data visually, to make visible the invisible on a map, how to lie with maps, how to do things with maps, and how architects, planners and urban designers use maps. These topics will be presented in a series of lectures at the beginning of the semester. Assigment. The course will then shift to working on our assignment will focus around the topic of Global New York City, Transnationalism and Migration. To do our work, we will look closely at local instantiations of global phenomena: how does transnationalism reveal itself in local ways and what does it means for pairs of nations? We will have access to the most up to date Remittances data, and will go on a number of fieldtrips in order to understand this phenomenon, its spatial manifestations in New York City, and its paired location elsewhere -- sometime rural, sometimes urban. We will also have access to a global network who will participate with us to provide us with information, images and even video.

Method of Instruction

ZEEGA: To facilitate our work, locally and globally, we will have the exciting opportunity to experiment with a new open-source platform for both mapping and storytelling: ZEEGA. "Zeega is an open-source HTML5 platform for creating interactive documentaries and inventing new forms of storytelling and mapmaking." Zeega will make it easy to collaboratively produce, curate and publish participatory multimedia projects online, on mobile devices and in physical spaces, illustrating local instantiations of global issues. Our seminar will produce a single product which is the result of individual projects around the global topic: Transnationalism in New York City: 2011\. Students will be directed in their research project based on their area of interest and highlight either visual and analytic methods(which means using Zeega), or writing projects which will contribute to the group project. No knowledge of computer programming is necessary for taking this course. For a quick introduction to Zeega, see: Zeega.org and, http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2011/08/zeega-enables-communities-to-create-interactivedocumentaries-new-forms-of-storytelling230.html

We will run a series of workshops to facilitate learning the software. If you do have programming experience, we welcome you to this course and will provide some programming workshops as well.

READINGS: will include selections from: Abrams and Hall. eds., Else/Where Mapping, Peter Galison's Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps, and Steven Johnson's The Ghost Map, Dodge Perkins: Rethinking Maps, Paul Stoller, Money has No Smell, Manuel Orozco, Sending Money Home, and many other articles and websites. All readings will be available on Courseworks or in PDF/xerox.

Method of Evaluation

REQUIREMENTS: You are expected to attend all meetings of the seminar, having read the assigned texts and projects for the week and prepared to discuss them. Your major work of the semester is an exploratory mapping project using ZEEGA which will be due at the end of the semester. We are reserving the last three weeks of the seminar to workshop the projects. NO PROGRAMMING SKILLS REQUIRED, but programming ability welcome.

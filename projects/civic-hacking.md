## civic hacking

“Civic” – (adj) of, or pertaining to a city, citizens, citizenship; e.g. civic engagement  
“Hacking” – (v) activity done by “hackers,” usually meaning computer related, but generalized to people who reuse, repurpose or bend processes, tools, etc to be used for other means; e.g. hacking the system

Technology is changing how people interact with the environment and how we understand the environment itself. Social Media, cell phones, social networking, crowdsourcing, apps, and other Web tools all provide a window into how people move, interact, feel, and even seen spaces. These tools, plus the Open Data Movement, have started to bridge the worlds of civic engagement and technology with cities and city agencies hosting “hackathons” and “app competitions.” Fundamentally technology of this type changes the relationship between citizen and city, reinvigorating conversations about power, access and democracy.

Civic Hacking is not necessarily contained to the digital realm. New resources and information available online are providing citizens tools for better understanding how the city works. With the information, data, and tools to empower and organize themselves, citizens are creating non-digital hacks on the city such as temporary uses for vacant lots, protest weddings, and urban farms.

As future planners, architects, urban designers, you will be part of bringing together the world of technology with urban spaces and designing new tools for community participation in the planning process. With your communities as your users, we will focus on using the Human-Centered Design (HCD) process in developing our ideas for these new tools.

This workshop class evolved from the Crowd Sourced City Class (FA10, FA11) and will explore the tools available for civic hacking in real life applications and focus on using the human-centered design process to change the future of participatory planning.

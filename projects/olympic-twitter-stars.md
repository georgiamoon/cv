## the new olympic stars (of twitter)

Using a streamgraph, we looked at how athletes were being discussed and mentioned on Twitter during the 2012 Olympic Games in London. During development of the visualization we built prototypes using [D3](http://d3js.org/) and Jason Sundram's [ProcessingJS](http://runningwithdata.com/post/566345323/streamgraph-js) version of Lee Byron's [Streamgraph](http://www.leebyron.com/else/streamgraph/) code.
